# network-map-metro
Forked from the CSS Tube Map created by John Galantini - https://github.com/oakleyarts/css-tube-map

I feel like the tube map style lends itself well to network diagrams. This repo is intended to show a map of my network. At some point, I may consider adding some kind of connectivity testing so it can double up as a network monitor.
